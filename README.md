# Interfacing Arduino with Gyroscope L3G4200D

Checkout the documentation site: 

The following project is an implementation as part of a Mini project which deals with interfacing **Arduino Uno with Gyroscope L3G4200D sensor**. 

The aim of the repository is to deep dive into 
- Working of the code
- Working of the sensor
- Pin engagement with the development board
- References to look out for

## Important Directions ðŸ§­

- Refer [Working of the Code](/code_explanation.md)
- Refer [Connection with Arduino Uno](/pin_engagement.md)
- Refer the [L3G4200D Datasheet](/L3G4200D%20datasheet.pdf)
